        <p>The only correct way to eat smarties is by crushing them up and snorting them.</p>
        <p>On reddit I found "It is better to throw away trash then to recycle it." </p>
        <p>Byclists shouln't be allowed on the road because every time I drive by one I feel like I'm going to hit them.</p>
        <p>Also from reddit "You should be allowed to keep the bones of your loved ones when they die." Could you imagine? "This pelvis fits perfectly over the fireplace what a great way to memorialize grandma."</p>
        <p>Soda tastes better when it isn't in a can. Even if you just pour it into a plastic cup it tastes better.</p>
        <p>In-n-Out burger is very mediocre and overhyped</p>
        <p>The movie Wicked was super long and it didn't even finish the story of the movie 4/10 stars</p>
        <p>Pinapple on pizza isn't bad, but it isn't crazy good. </p>
        <p>Christmas music shouldn't be played until after thanksgiving. We literally have an entire holiday about being thankful, and no one is thankful for it because they just want christmas.</p>
        <p>Theme parks are expensive, and not very fun.</p>
